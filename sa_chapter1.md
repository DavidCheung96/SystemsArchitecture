# Computer Types
* Embedded Computers: are integrated into al larger device or system in order to automatically monitor or control it.
  - They are used for spesific purposes.
  - Typical applications *(Industrial, home automation, telecommunuciaton products)*
* Personal Computers: primarily for dedicated individual use.
  - Desktops computers, Workstation computers, Portable and Notebook computers.
* Servers *and* Enterprise Systems: are large computers that are meant to be shared by a potentially large number of users who access them  	from some personal computer over a network.
* Supercomputers *and* Grid Computers:
  - Most expansive and physically largest computers.
  - Mostly used for weather, engineering simuation and design
  - Grid computers provide a more cost-effective alternative. Which uses large number of personal computers and disk storage units in a high-speed network, called a grid, which is managed as a coordinated computing resouce.
  
# Functional Units
A computer consists of five functionally independent main parts:
- I/O
  - input
  - output
- momory
- Processor
  - arithmetic and logic    
  - control units
  
## Input Unit
Computers accept coded information through input units such as keyboards and things like that.
## Memory Unit
The function of the memory unit is to store programs and data.
1. __Primary Memory__
Also called *main memory*, is a fast memory that operates at electronic speeds. Programs must be stored in this memory while they are being executed. The memory consists of large number of storage cells, each capable of storing one bit of information and they work in group of fixed size called *words (typical word lengths are 16,32,64 bit)*. A memory in which any location can be accessed in a short and fixed amount of time after specifying its address is called a *random-access memory (RAM)*. The teime required to access one word is *memory access time*.
2. __Cache Memory__
Cache basically is a small and faster version of ram. Its used to hold sections of program that are currently executed.
3. __Second Storage__
The secondary storage can hold more data and keep them even after it turned off. *Exp= HDD, DVD, CD, USB*
