# Computer Types
* Embedded Computers: are integrated into al larger device or system in order to automatically monitor or control it.
  - They are used for spesific purposes.
  - Typical applications *(Industrial, home automation, telecommunuciaton products)*
* Personal Computers: primarily for dedicated individual use.
  - Desktops computers, Workstation computers, Portable and Notebook computers.
* Servers *and* Enterprise Systems: are large computers that are meant to be shared by a potentially large number of users who access them  	from some personal computer over a network.
* Supercomputers *and* Grid Computers:
  - Most expansive and physically largest computers.
  - Mostly used for weather, engineering simuation and design
  - Grid computers provide a more cost-effective alternative. Which uses large number of personal computers and disk storage units in a high-speed network, called a grid, which is managed as a coordinated computing resouce.
  
# Functional Units
  A computer consists of five functionally independent main parts:
    - I/O
      - input
